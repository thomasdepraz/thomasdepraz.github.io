							<h3>Context</h3>
							<p>
								This was my second project using Unity. 
								We had to create a zelda inspired action adventure game again 
								using pixel art graphics. Our group was composed of 4 game artists 
								and 3 game designers. We had some guidelines to create the gameplay 
								mechanics, there had to be 3 different enemies, puzzles, and a boss. 
								Again we were free to create the story and the universe of the game.<br/> 
								Unfortunately, we went on lockdown right at the end of the 
								pre-production of the game, and it was quite hard to adapt
							</p>
							<h3>About Hook</h3>
							<p>
								Hook is a zelda-like game where you play as an Axolotl defending 
								his village against crabs. 
								You have to save the villagers kidnapped by the crabs, 
								and defeat their boss. <br/>

								With the help of your <b>grappling hook</b> you have to <b>solve puzzles</b> 
								and slay the crabs standing in your way. You will meet a lot of 
								characters which will help you during your quest.
							</p>
							<h3>My Work</h3>
							<p>
								On this project I was <b>Lead Game Programmer</b>, meaning I had to write 
								documentation about programming nomenclature, the Git workflow etc…
								I also had to verify my colleagues code and help them whenever I could. 
								I wrote parts of the Game Design Document, especially the <b>technical 
								parts</b> that were going to be used later on, during development. <br/>
								I worked a bit on the <b>player controller</b> especially on the grappling 
								hook, which was quite a <b>challenging mechanic</b> to develop. I also worked 
								on the enemies of the game, except the boss. I developed a lot of the 
								<b>interactable objects</b> used to create puzzles, such as pressure plates, 
								doors, crates, rafts etc…
							</p>
							<h3>Conclusion</h3>
							<p>
								This project was really ambitious and we had a hard time wrapping 
								it up especially since we were on lockdown and unable to see each 
								other. Though, I am very pleased with the result. 
								I learned a lot being the lead programmer on this project.
								At times, it was really hard to take on my responsibilities. 
								My knowledge of Unity and C# programming grew even more and I am 
								really proud of what we managed to do as a team.
