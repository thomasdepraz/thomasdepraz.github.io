							<h3>Context</h3>
							<p>
								Pirate Academy was a pure game designer project. 
								As a matter of fact, the team was composed of 45 game designers. 
								We had to create every aspect of the game ourselves. 
								We had few constraints, the theme of the game was decided by vote, 
								and we just had to respect the WarioWare base constraints such as the rhythm, 
								the sequence of mini-game etc...
								
							</p>
							<h3>About Pirate Academy</h3>		
							<p>	
								Pirate Academy is about a pirate crew that tries to pass their pirate exam. 
								They sail on the sea, navigating between islands, trying to survive the mini-game on the way to the Boss. 
							</p>

							<h3>My Work</h3>
							<p>
								As part of the core programming team, 
								I was in charge of developing the macro-game, 
								(meaning the game holding all the mini-games). 
								Personally, I developed various features, like the shop, the inventory, 
								the player movement between islands and a lot of smaller sub-features. 
								At the beginning of the project we also had to evaluate the technical feasibility 
								of the various projects presented for the vote. We had to create a very large and 
								comprehensive documentation on how one would create his mini-game and the various guidelines 
								to use the Unity Project.
							</p>
							<h3>Conclusion</h3>
							<p>
								As a gameplay programmer this was a very challenging project. 
								We had to bear a lot of responsibilities toward the rest of the team and it
								was a lot of pressure to deal with but it was motivating nonetheless. 
								Creating the documentation was also a difficult exercise and I learned a lot from it. 
								I am really glad about how the game turned out, even though there are still a few minor 
								bugs waiting to be fixed. It was a whole new experience to work in such a large group as 
								it allowed us to be more specialized in our work and do what we do best.
