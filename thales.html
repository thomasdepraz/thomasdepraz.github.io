							<h3>Context</h3>
							<p>
								Thales : The Card Game was an order form ThalesGroup. 
								We had to create a card game to present their anti-submarine defense solutions. 
								We had a lot of constraints from ThalesGroup to create a game that fits them best. 
								Our group was composed of 12 game designers. The project lasted 4 months. 
							</p>
							<h3>About Thales : The Card Game</h3>		
							<p>	
								Thales : the Card Game is a two player coop-card game where you play 
								as a frigate and a maritime patrol plane. Your goal is to spot an enemy 
								submarine and prevent him from accomplishing his mission. 
								In order to do that, you use the ThalesGroup equipement from the frigate and the plane. 
							</p>

							<h3>My Work</h3>
							<p>
								On this project, I helped design some of the game mechanics, 
								I mainly focused on the frigate mechanics during the early iterations of the game. 
								Later on during the production I was part of the playtesting team of the group. 
								We had to organize playtests and test every new iteration of the game to balance the core mechanics. 
							</p>
							<h3>Conclusion</h3>
							<p>
								This was a very interesting project. First of all, we had to deal with the pressure of delivering 
								a fine prototype at the end to our client, ThalesGroup. 
								We also had to do the game’s visuals ourselves since there were no game artists on this project. 
								The group was composed of very skilled people so the project went really smoothly. 
								We sometimes had a hard time to move on from a failed iteration and start over but 
								overall I think that we delivered a good card game.
