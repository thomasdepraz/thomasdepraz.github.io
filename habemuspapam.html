							<p>Habemus Papam is a boardgame about cardinals trying to become the next pope during the 1492's Conclave. It's designed for 4 players each of them taking the place of Rodriguo Borgia, Asciano Sforza, Oliviero Carafa or Giuliano della Rovere.</br> Gather influence, lie to your opponents, stab them in the back, corrupt cardinals, every means are great when yo want to become the Pope in 1492.</p>
							<p>It was created over the course of one school year by 3 game designers, including myself, and 3 game artists. In our team, everyone had a specific task. For example, I was charged of prototyping, so i had to make a new prototype everytime there was a major update on the game's graphics. </br>I am very proud of this project and what we achieved in one year. Don't hesitate checking my friend's <a href="edmurat.com">website</a> where you can read devlogs about the game.</p>
