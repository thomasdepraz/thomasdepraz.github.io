							<h3>Context</h3>
							<p>
								Katana is the first project where I used Unity. 
								The challenge was to make a roguelike vertical slice, with pixel-art graphics. 
								Our group was composed of 3 game artists and 4 game designers. 
								Together, we were free to create the universe of the game and the gameplay mechanics.
							</p>
							<h3>About K.A.T.A.N.A</h3>
							<p>
								Katana is a roguelike game where you play as a ninja who always wanted to be a cook. 
								Unfortunately the restaurant you bought is haunted by evil vegetables. 
								You have to slay them in order to bring back peace to your canteen.
								<br />
								During each run you can <b>collect ingredients</b> from the vegetables you killed. 
								This allows you to <b>cook various meals</b> when you return to the hub. 
								Each meal makes you stronger but it consumes some of the ingredients you collected. 
								</p>
							<h3>My Work</h3>
							<p>
								At first, I helped design the various mechanics of the game before 
								I started prototyping using the very detailed game design document written by my colleagues. 
								<br/>
								Since it was my first project using Unity, I wanted to explore 
								as much of the game engine as possible. I created the <b>player controller</b>, 
								his movement, his attacks... 
								I worked on some of <b>the enemies</b>, their attack pattern… 
								I also created the <b>cooking system</b>, which used the ingredients collected during the run. 
								I integrated a lot of the graphics using the Animator 
								with the help of the game artists. Finally, I worked a lot on the <b>game’s UI</b>, 
								especially the one for the cooking system. 
								</p>
							<h3>Conclusion</h3>
							<p>
								I had a lot of fun making this project and I am very proud 
								of the result even though we had to cut some content. 
								We had a really <b>good synergy</b> together and it created an environment 
								where we felt safe to create, and fail sometimes...  
								If I had to do it again, I would totally work differently since 
								I learned a lot on this and other projects. <br/>

								This project really helped me to get better at <b>C# programming</b>
								and get a bit more confident in my skills.
